# $P Point-Cloud Gesture Recognizer

# About

The $P Point-Cloud Recognizer is a 2-D stroke-gesture recognizer designed for rapid prototyping of gesture-based user interfaces. By representing gestures as point-clouds, $P can handle both unistrokes and multistrokes equivalently, and without the combinatoric overhead of $N, as stroke number, order, and direction are all ignored. When comparing two point-clouds, $P finds a solution to the classic assignment problem between two bipartite graphs using an approximation of the Hungarian algorithm.
